# Charmed, I'm Sure

## Top-down spell-casting against a zombie horde, with a charming twist.

Survive a zombie horde for as long as you can, charm new hosts once you have died before the timer runs out!

Use WASD to move and the arrow keys to shoot charms at an ever-increasing wave of slug-like zombies that stand between you and a high score. This isn't any ordinary top-down shooter however, as you can persevere after death by charming zombies and playing as them if you're quick enough after having being eaten by the horde!

This was my first time attempting the usual format of a video game, with a movable player-character and enemies to defeat. I decided to try to fit as many references to the theme of the GameJam, 'Charm', into the game as possible. These definitions included: The Charms collected for more points that are dropped by Zombies with Charms on their heads; The Charms cast by the wizard that are the players attacks in the game; The way that you cheat death in this game is to Charm a zombie with a gemstone in it's head and to take it as your host, allowing you to continue your run; and hopefully the art style and vibe of this project by someone new to game design is Charming.

This Project was developed using godot - with instancing and spawning being used for the enemies, pickups and end screen - in order to develop my skills in godot and with modular programming in game design. I have made 2 previous projects in godot and this 3 day GameJam helped me to develop some of the skills that I have been working on with the engine. I thoroughly enjoyed also going with a drawn art-syle for this project as it allowed me to work more in an area of digital art production that I have used in the past, and because I have designed my previous projects to work with very angular and exact vector imagery.
